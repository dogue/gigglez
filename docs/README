Summary
-------

GIRC-Bot (or Gigglez IRC Bot) is a framework for building IRC bots written entirely in PHP.
Originally developed as a private bot for the [REDACTED] clan (http://[REDACTED]) for administrating our Urban Terror servers,
the project has since evolved into an open-source framework that anyone can use to build their own custom IRC bots.
Built with a modular design, GIRC-Bot is designed to be easy to learn, easy to develop for, and easy to maintain, all without sacrificing functionality.


Modules
-------

GIRC-Bot modules use the .girc extension (just a cosmetic choice) and are separated into various folders based on what events they handle.
For example, a module that is designed to respond from commands sent via a channel go into the modules/channel folder.
Modules are loaded each time one of the events is handled.
This allows modules to be added/removed/modified on the fly, without the need to restart the bot.
There are a few key pieces of data that are passed to the module when it is called.
The $level variable (the user's access-level) is passed to all modules.
However, the other data passed to the modules varies depending on the event being handled.
See the example modules in each category for more information on what data each module receives.


Config
------

The GIRC-Bot config is a YAML (http://yaml.org/) file containing the information the bot needs to connect to the server, access MySQL, and a few other things.
See the comments in the config for more information.


Database/User Privileges
------------------------

GIRC-Bot uses a MySQL database to store user privilege information. The privilege system is based on linking a numeric access-level designation to the user's user@host.
For example, you might have an entry with the following: (hostmask, level) VALUES ('~[REDACTED]@[REDACTED]', '600').
Included is a database creation script (docs/database_template.sql) that can be used to set up a table for the bot.
Please note that this script does NOT create a database, but only the "girc_users" table.
If you're unsure how to use this file, please see this page: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/batch-commands.html


Notes
-----

If you're using GIRC-Bot on Windows with PHP 5.3 (not sure about earlier versions), you will likely notice very poor performance.
This is a bug in PHP, not in GIRC-Bot. This project is developed, maintained, and tested on Linux systems and runs without issue.
I have researched several solutions (via a few hours with Google), and was unable to get the PHP CLI to perform normally under Windows 7 Enterprise x86.
If you find a solution, or know if it works properly on a certain version of Windows, please let me know.
